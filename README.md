# fltkhs-light-theme-skeleton
This is a skeleton app to help get going with a light themed FLTKHS native GUI application. To install clone this repo then do:

    > stack build --flag fltkhs:bundled
    > stack exec fltkhs-light-theme-skeleton

My fork is for the exercises in Typeclasses' Timepieces course.
